In this folder is my replication of Tables 1 and 2 "The Effect of Veterans Benefits on Education and Earnings" within Stata and SAS.
Also, included are two plots that are not in the paper.
I created them to showcase the relationships between multiple variables.
The dataset used for the SAS code is the a1993rep.xls located in this folder.
The dataset used for the Stata code is the Angrist1993Replication.dta located in this folder.

This folder consists of my work on my research project that was completed throughout my Masters degree.
There was three areas that made up project.
The first step in the project was to find an economics paper and replicate the main findings of the paper. 
The paper I selected was "Subperfect Game: Profitable Biases of NBA Referees" by Price, Remer, and Stone.
The next step was to conduct model specification tests to determine whether the models used by the authors was the correct specifications.
The last step was an extension of the original paper, where I used the results found in the article to determine whether the referee biases casused inefficiencies in the side-lines betting market.
Each folder will contain the code, data, and final paper detailing the results I found in each step.
